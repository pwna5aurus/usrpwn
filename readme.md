This is my attempt to create a (basic) frontend for running pre-generated Python scripts from GNURadio.

I built a small Raspberry Pi touch screen setup and the screen is dinky and it's really hard to navigate with fingers so I wanted a UI that was basically just push-button, with some parameter fields that could be customized and passed as args to GNURadio scripts.  Ideally, this works best with a USRP SDR (I am using the B210), since the HackRF already has the Portapack for portability.  

Will upload some pictures of this monstrosity when it's closer to done.
